        <h1>What is Splodo?</h1>
        <p>
            Splodo is a platform made for creating value through text components that you create yourself. Have you ever wanted to express something 
            in words, and create further value with it? <strong>We bet you have.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
        Even if Splodo can be used for anything, the fundamental purpose with the Splodo project is about
            celebrating great ideas. 
        The project came to reality after the founder of the initiative, Samuel Swarén wanted to
            gather his own golden moments when experiencing neat things. The main goal of the project 
            is to develop a community driven by ideas, appriciation, and hype. 
        </p>

        <p>
        If the concept of Splodos and how and when to use them seems abstract for you, the community pages given by the 
        developers of the platform is a good place to start. 
        </p>

        <h3>However, Splodo shows its best 
        side when you are taking use of it. In whatever way you want to.  </h3>
