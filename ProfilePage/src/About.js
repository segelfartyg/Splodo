        <h1>What is Splodo?</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever come across something revolutionary and wanted to spread the word to everyone about it?
            Have you ever eaten at a great restaurant?
            Or bought something awesome on Amazon? <strong>We bet you have.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
        Even if Splodo can be used for anything, the fundamental purpose with the Splodo project is about
            celebrating great ideas. 
        The project came to reality after the founder of the initiative, Samuel Swar√©n wanted to
            gather his own golden moments when experiencing neat things. The main goal of the project 
            is to develop a community driven by ideas, appriciation, and hype. 
        </p>

        <p>
        If the concept of Splodos and how and when to use them seems abstract for you, the featured Splodos given by the 
        developers of this community is a good place to start.

        <h3>However, Splodo shows its best 
        side when you are taking use of it. In whatever way you want to.  </h3>
